These files have been tested and used to generate a live ELK deployment on Azure. They can be used to recreate the entire deployment pictured above. Alternatively, select portions of the <a href="https://github.com/RhondaLynch/Azure-Networking-Project/blob/main/Ansible/install_elk.yml.jpg" target="_top">install_elk.yml</a> file may be used to install only certain pieces of it, such as Filebeat.

### Description of the Topology

The main purpose of this network is to expose a load-balanced and monitored instance of DVWA, the Damn Vulnerable Web Application.

Load balancing not only ensures that the application will be highly available, but also that incoming traffic flowing to the webservers is restricted to the project owner's Public IP via HTTP port 80, requiring only one rule regardless of the number of webservers now or in the future. Likewise the Jump-Box is used as the sole ssh gateway into the network via port 22 and limited, in this case, to the project owner's public IP address.

Integrating an ELK server allows users to easily monitor the vulnerable VMs for changes to the logs, as well as system and application metrics.

The configuration details of each machine may be found below.

| Name     | Function | IP Address | Operating System |
|----------|----------|------------|------------------|
| Jump Box | Gateway    | 10.0.0.5 | Linux            |
| Web-1    | Web Server | 10.0.0.6 | Linux            |
| Web-2    | Web Server | 10.0.0.7 | Linux            |
| Web-3    | Web Server | 10.0.0.8 | Linux            |

### Access Policies

The machines on the internal network are not exposed to the public Internet. 

Only the Jump-Box machine can accept ssh connections via port 22 from the Internet. Access to this machine is only allowed from the following IP addresses: xxx.xx.xxx.x

Machines within the network can only be accessed by the Jump-Box Provisioner (Public IP:52.160.125.3 Private IP:10.0.0.5) .

A summary of the access policies in place can be found in the table below.

| Name               | Publicly Accessible | Allowed IP Addresses |
|--------------------|---------------------|----------------------|
| Jump Box           | Yes (ssh p22)       | xxx.xx.xxx.x         |
| Elk Server (Web-A) | Yes (tcp p5601)     | xxx.xx.xxx.x         |
| Load Balancer      | Yes (http p80)      | xxx.xx.xxx.x         |
| Web-1              | No                  | 10.0.0.5             |
| Web-2              | No                  | 10.0.0.5             |
| Web-3              | No                  | 10.0.0.5             |



### Elk Configuration

Ansible was used to automate configuration of the ELK machine from the Jumpbox ansible container hungry_euclid, by executing the <a href="https://github.com/RhondaLynch/Azure-Networking-Project/blob/main/Ansible/install_elk.yml.jpg" target="_top">install_elk.yml file</a>. No configuration was performed manually, which is advantageous because any number of webservers can be done by one script.  This also allows easy update should more webservers be added in the future.

The playbook implements the following tasks:
- Install Docker.io
- Install python3-pip
- Create, image and launch a docker container
- Assign ports to the docker container
- Enable Docker

The following screenshot displays the result of running `docker ps` after successfully configuring the ELK instance.

### Target Machines & Beats
This ELK server is configured to monitor the following machines:
- Web-1 10.0.0.6
- Web-2 10.0.0.7
- Web-3 10.0.0.8

We have installed the following Beats on these DVWA machines by running the yml files shown below from the Jumpbox ansible container, hungry_euclid:
- <a href="https://github.com/RhondaLynch/Azure-Networking-Project/blob/main/Ansible/filebeat-playbook.yml.jpg" target="_top">Filebeat</a>
- <a href="https://github.com/RhondaLynch/Azure-Networking-Project/blob/main/Ansible/metricbeat-playbook.yml.jpg" target="_top">Metricbeat</a>

These Beats allow us to collect the following information from each machine:
- Filebeat: Filebeat is a customizable vehicle for forwarding and centralizing log events to tools such as Elasticsearch or Logstash for indexing and manipulation to be visually displayed in tools such as Kibana
- Metricbeat: Metricbeat monitors and accumulates system information such as CPU usage, memory, file system etc., and forwards the data to tools such as Elasticsearch or Logstash for further manipulation and anlysis.  This information can then be visualized via tools such as Kibana.  Metricbeat is also customizable.  

### Using the Playbook
In order to use the playbook, you will need to have an Ansible control node already configured. Assuming you have such a control node provisioned: 

SSH into the control node and follow the steps below:
- Copy the <a href="https://github.com/RhondaLynch/Azure-Networking-Project/blob/main/Ansible/filebeat-playbook.yml.jpg" target="_top">Filebeat yml file</a> and <a href="https://github.com/RhondaLynch/Azure-Networking-Project/blob/main/Ansible/metricbeat-playbook.yml.jpg" target="_top">Metricbeat yml file</a> to /etc/ansible/roles within the ansible container.
- Update the /etc/ansible/hosts file within the ansible container to include the <a href="https://github.com/RhondaLynch/Azure-Networking-Project/blob/main/Ansible/hosts.jpg" target="_top">webservers and elk server</a>
- Navigate to the <a href="https://github.com/RhondaLynch/Azure-Networking-Project/blob/main/Ansible/filebeat-config.yml.jpg" target="_top">Filebeat-config.yml</a> and <a href="https://github.com/RhondaLynch/Azure-Networking-Project/blob/main/Ansible/metricbeat-config.yml.jpg" target="_top">Metricbeat-config.yml</a> files in /etc/ansible within the container to configure to identify the host port, username and password for Elasticsearch and Kibana.
- Run the playbook, and navigate to Kibana at 40.117.114.71:5601/app/kibana to check that the installation worked as expected.

### Commands used to run playbooks:
First, make sure that your Azure machines are running.
- ssh from windows git bash to the Network Jumpbox
  - ssh rhondalynch@52.160.125.3
- Make sure that docker is running at that your container is running:
   - sudo systemctl start docker
   - sudo docker exec -it hungry_euclid /bin/bash
- Go into the ansible container
   - sudo docker exec -ti hungry_euclid /bin/bash
- After ensuring that setup (detailed above) is complete in all yml & config files, as well as the host file, run the the yml files
   - ansible-playbook /etc/ansible/install-elk.yml
   - ansible-playbook /etc/ansible/filebeat-playbook.yml
   - ansible-playbook /etc/ansible/metricbeat-playbook.yml

Any errors in the playbook will be indicated and need to be corrected and re-run.
